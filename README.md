**Live preview:** [dpierson9833.github.io/statesboro-showcase](https://dpierson9833.github.io/statesboro-showcase)

## What This Is

This is a **rewrite proposal** — a working static mockup showing what a modernized Statesboro Karate website could look like. All content is sourced from the existing live sites at statesborokarate.com and richmondhillkaratecenter.com.

## Key Improvements Over Current Site

- **No Elementor dependency** — pure HTML/CSS/JS, fast and maintainable
- **Dark martial arts aesthetic** — black/red/white palette fitting the brand
- **All programs represented** — Tang Soo Do, Krav Maga, BJJ, Bully Busters
- **All 3 locations** — Statesboro, Richmond Hill, Twin City
- **Martial arts lineage** — highlighted as a selling point
- **Mobile-responsive** — works on all devices
- **SEO-friendly** — proper meta tags, semantic HTML
- **Fast loading** — no page builder bloat

## Tech Stack

- Vanilla HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript
- Google Fonts (Oswald + Inter)
- CSS Grid + Flexbox layouts
- Intersection Observer for scroll animations
- Zero dependencies
